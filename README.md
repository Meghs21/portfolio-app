# Portfolio Website using Streamlit

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website built using **Streamlit** in Python. The portfolio showcases all the projects I have worked on and includes a **Contact Me** page, where visitors can send me messages directly to my email. It serves as an interactive, dynamic platform for potential employers, collaborators, and others to learn about my work and get in touch with me easily.

## Features
- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated page to display and provide details on the projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
- **Contact Form**: Visitors can fill out a form, and their message will be sent directly to my email.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Streamlit, ensuring compatibility across devices.
- **Streamlined Navigation**: Easy navigation between different sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact.

## How It Works
- The homepage provides an overview of who I am and my professional background.
- The **Projects** page lists and describes each of my projects, providing details such as project description, technology stack, and links to source code or live demos.
- The **Contact Me** page allows users to enter their name, email, and a message. Upon submission, an email is automatically sent to my inbox using a configured email service (e.g., SMTP).
